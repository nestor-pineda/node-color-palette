# Node Server for Color Palettes

 I've creates a Node.js server and linked it with MongoDB. 
There are three collections

 - Users


 - Colors


 - Palettes


 Users have the capability of making a registes, loggin in and loggin out of theis accounts.

 Once a user is logged in, the have the permission to ADD new color to the DB, create palets with their favourite colors and edit theire palettes.

 They won`t be able to delete or modify others paletter.
